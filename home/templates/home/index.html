            <p>I'm Emily. A 27 year old former fast fashion lover. But now I'm a huge advocate for all things
                secondhand. I'm living proof that people and habits can change, and before you know it, you'll never
                look back. I love working on this business with my mum, and I hope you can see our passion and
                enthusiasm for sustainability in every item.</p>

            <p>I'm Tracey, a proud mother of five, and now a business owner. My love of nature and the world around us
                has led me on a journey of understanding that in order to help this poorly planet, we all need to do our
                bit. My bit, is creating beautiful, one-off, hand-crafted pieces that don't cost the earth - literally!â€‹
